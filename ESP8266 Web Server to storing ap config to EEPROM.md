# ESP8266 Web Server to storing ap config to EEPROM.

## Original by chriscook8 from esp8266.com I just modified to use ESP8266WebServer library for easy to handle the http request.

This is sample code not yet complete.

## Todo

- [ ] when Wifi connected need to close the softAP.

- [ ] maybe some dns with ESP8266mDNS.

## Use

1. authen to softAP `test` with password `test`
2. go to `192.168.4.1` and enter your ssid
3. restart esp!
